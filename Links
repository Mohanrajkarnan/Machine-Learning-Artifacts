Outliers
=========

- Know the value of 1st quartile(25%) and 2nd quartile(50%) and 3rd quartile(75%)
- Find IQR = Q3(Values) - Q1(Values)
- Q1-(1.5 *IQR) for left (any value lesser than <-- is outlier)
- Q3+(1.5 * IQR) for right (any value greater than <-- is outlier)

Correlation
================

-1   -0.25   0    0.25    1

From -0.25 to +0.25 is not intrested
From -0.25 to -1 is intrested
From +0.25 to +1 is intrested


RFE Rankings
============

x= Columns
y = Target column
call LinearRegression()
Call RFE method:
	rfemod = RFE(lmmod,1)
Train the model:
	rfemod.fit(x,y)
Make Ranking:
	rankingdf = pd.DataFrame(rfemod.ranking_).T
	rankingdf.columns = x.columns
	rankingdf
